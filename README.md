Hi! Dev here,
I devlopment this project to demonstrate how to use React to build a simple Github repository viewer and I use a API to get the data of github my repositories. Maybe in the future I will add more features to this project and expand the functionality for more developers show their repositories in a simple way.

```

Move to directory and run the program:

```

Install dependencies:

npm install
``` 

## Usage example

In this version you only can see my repositories. 

## Release History

## Coming Soon

Make a good UI and add more features for login to github and show the repositories of the user.
